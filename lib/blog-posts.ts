    title: 'Mint Shut Down. Here\'s What to Use Instead (Free)',
    excerpt: 'Mint closed in January 2024. Millions of users needed an alternative. Here\'s the honest breakdown of your free options.',
    date: '2026-06-01',
    category: 'Alternatives',
    content: `Mint shut down on January 1, 2024. If you\'re still looking for a replacement, here\'s the honest breakdown.

**What Mint did well:**
- Free bill tracking
- Subscription detection via bank sync
- Spending categories
- Budget alerts

**What people hated about Mint:**
- Intuit acquired it and let it rot
- Constant upsells to Credit Karma
- Bank sync that broke constantly
- Privacy concerns around sharing bank credentials

**Your free options today:**

**RenewalMate** — free forever, manual entry, no bank sync required. Best for people who want to track subscriptions and recurring bills without sharing bank login credentials.

**LowerMySubs** — free, focused specifically on subscriptions, has guides for canceling 50+ services.

**PocketGuard free tier** — very limited, but tracks subscriptions if you connect a bank account.

**The paid options (if you want full budgeting):**
- Monarch Money ($14.99/mo) — closest full replacement to Mint
- YNAB ($14.99/mo) — zero-based budgeting, steeper learning curve
- Simplifi ($6.99/mo) — from Quicken, cheaper

**The honest take:** If you just want to see your subscriptions and bills in one place without paying or sharing your bank login, RenewalMate is the move. If you want a full financial operating system with investment tracking, Monarch is worth the $15/month. Nothing else in the free category matches what Mint was at its peak.`,

    excerpt: 'Rocket Money charges you to tell you where your money is going. That\'s backwards. Here\'s a free alternative.',
    date: '2026-06-02',
    category: 'Alternatives',
    content: `Rocket Money (formerly Truebill) charges $6-12/month for features that shouldn\'t cost anything.

Here\'s what you\'re paying for: a dashboard that shows your subscriptions, alerts before renewals, and bill negotiation services. The bill negotiation is the one feature that\'s genuinely hard to replicate — they call your providers and negotiate lower rates, taking a cut of what they save you.

But here\'s the thing: most people don\'t use bill negotiation. They sign up to track subscriptions and then pay $12/month to do it. That\'s backwards.

**What RenewalMate does for free:**
- Full subscription and bill dashboard
- Overdue, due soon, and on track views
- Manual entry — no bank credentials required
- Renewal awareness so nothing surprises you

**What Rocket Money does that we don\'t (yet):**
- Automatic subscription detection via bank sync
- Bill negotiation (takes a percentage of savings)
- Investment tracking

**The math:** If you pay Rocket Money $12/month and they negotiate one bill down $10/month, they might take $5 of that. You\'re paying $12 to save $5. Run the numbers on your own situation.

**If you don\'t use bill negotiation:** You\'re paying $12/month to track your subscriptions. RenewalMate does that for $0.

**If you do use bill negotiation:** Rocket Money might make sense. But try calling providers yourself first — most will match competitor rates if you ask.`,

    title: 'The Average Person Wastes $273/Month on Subscriptions. Are You?',
    excerpt: 'Research consistently shows people dramatically underestimate their subscription spending. Here\'s how to find out exactly what you\'re paying.',
    date: '2026-06-03',
    category: 'Personal Finance',
    content: `C+R Research found the average American spends $219/month on subscriptions. West Monroe puts it higher at $273. Either way, most people think they spend about $80.

The gap between what people think they spend and what they actually spend is the whole problem.

**Why subscriptions are so hard to track:**
They\'re designed to be easy to forget. Monthly charges that feel small ($14.99 here, $9.99 there) add up to hundreds of dollars. Services you signed up for and stopped using still charge every month. Annual subscriptions hit once and then fall off your radar.

**The categories people forget:**
- Software trials that converted to paid
- Family plan shares you\'re still paying for
- Annual services that renewed automatically
- App subscriptions buried in your phone\'s billing
- Gym memberships after the "New Year resolution" fade

**How to find out what you\'re actually paying:**

Option 1 (free, takes 20 minutes): Go through your bank and credit card statements for the last 60 days. Write down every recurring charge. Group by category. Add it up. Most people are shocked.

Option 2 (free, ongoing): Use RenewalMate to track everything going forward. Add each bill as you find it. Your dashboard shows what\'s coming up so nothing surprises you.

Option 3 (requires bank access): Connect Rocket Money or Monarch Money to detect subscriptions automatically.

The point isn\'t the tool — it\'s visibility. You can\'t cancel what you don\'t know you\'re paying for.`,

    excerpt: 'Most budget apps require bank access. You don\'t have to give it. Here\'s a privacy-first approach to tracking your expenses.',
    date: '2026-06-04',
    category: 'Privacy',
    content: `Every major budgeting app wants your bank login. Rocket Money, Monarch, YNAB, Mint (RIP) — they all use Plaid or a similar service to connect directly to your accounts and pull transaction data.

Here\'s what that actually means: a third-party service (usually Plaid) stores your bank credentials or a long-lived access token. They can see every transaction. If they\'re breached, your financial data is exposed.

**You don\'t have to do this.**

The alternative is manual tracking. Yes, it takes more effort. But here\'s the tradeoff: your bank credentials stay between you and your bank.

**How manual tracking works:**
1. You add your bills and subscriptions yourself
2. You set the amount and renewal date
3. Your dashboard shows what\'s overdue, due soon, and on track
4. You get alerts before things renew

**What you lose with manual tracking:**
- Automatic detection of new subscriptions
- Real-time transaction sync
- Spending categorization across all purchases

**What you gain:**
- Your bank credentials never leave your bank
- No third-party can see your transactions
- No dependency on Plaid uptime or security
- The app can\'t be breached to expose your data

**Who should use manual tracking:**
- Anyone who doesn\'t trust third-party financial data aggregators
- People who had a Plaid-connected app breached
- Anyone whose main goal is tracking recurring bills (not all spending)

RenewalMate is built for manual tracking. No bank sync, no Plaid, no credentials. Add your bills, see your dashboard, stay on top of renewals.`,

    title: 'YNAB vs RenewalMate: Which One Do You Actually Need?',
    excerpt: 'YNAB is $180/year and requires a mindset shift. RenewalMate is free. Here\'s how to decide which one is right for you.',
    date: '2026-06-05',
    category: 'Alternatives',
    content: `YNAB (You Need A Budget) is genuinely one of the best personal finance tools ever made. It\'s also $14.99/month and requires you to completely rethink how you manage money.

RenewalMate is free and takes 10 minutes to set up.

**When you need YNAB:**
- You want zero-based budgeting — every dollar has a job before you spend it
- You\'re trying to get out of debt and need a system
- You want to budget every spending category, not just recurring bills
- You\'re committed to the methodology and willing to spend time learning it

**When you need RenewalMate:**
- You mostly want to know what\'s due and when
- Subscriptions and bills are your main concern, not all discretionary spending
- You don\'t want to pay $180/year to track recurring expenses
- You don\'t want to connect your bank to a third-party app
- You\'re coming from Mint and want a free replacement

**The honest take:**
YNAB changes lives for people who commit to it. If you want a full budgeting system and you\'re willing to pay for it, YNAB is worth considering.

If you just want to stop forgetting about subscriptions and get surprised by bills, that\'s not YNAB\'s core value prop — and you shouldn\'t pay $180/year for it.

Most people need RenewalMate first. If you outgrow it and want a full system, YNAB will still be there.`,

    title: 'How to Find and Cancel Subscriptions You Forgot You Have',
    excerpt: 'A step-by-step process for auditing your subscriptions, finding forgotten charges, and actually canceling them.',
    date: '2026-05-28',
    category: 'Personal Finance',
    content: `Most people have at least 3-5 subscriptions they\'re paying for but not using. Here\'s how to find them and kill them.

**Step 1: Pull your statements.**
Go back 60 days on every payment method: checking account, credit cards, PayPal, Venmo (business payments). Look for recurring charges — same amount, monthly or annually.

**Step 2: List everything.**
Write it down. Don\'t evaluate yet, just list. Amount, service name, when it charges, which card.

**Step 3: Ask yourself the questions.**
For each subscription:
- Have I used this in the last 30 days?
- Would I re-subscribe today if I wasn\'t already?
- Is the price worth what I actually get?

If any answer is no, cancel.

**Step 4: The cancellation process.**
Most subscription companies make canceling deliberately hard. Common tactics: bury the cancel button, require a phone call, offer a discount to stay, require email instead of online cancellation.

For the hard ones: call during business hours, be direct ("I want to cancel my subscription"), decline all retention offers, ask for an email confirmation.

**Step 5: Track what\'s left.**
After the audit, add your remaining subscriptions to a tracker. Set renewal dates. Never be surprised again.

**Services with notoriously bad cancellation:**
- Planet Fitness (requires in-person cancellation)
- SiriusXM (phone required)
- Adobe (retention gauntlet)
- Amazon Prime (not obvious, but findable in account settings)

The work is worth it. A 20-minute audit typically finds $30-80/month in unused subscriptions.`,

    title: 'Subscription Fatigue Is Real. Here\'s How to Fight It.',
    excerpt: 'Everything is a subscription now. Software, TV, music, news, gym, food, clothes. Here\'s a framework for deciding what stays.',
    date: '2026-05-25',
    category: 'Personal Finance',
    content: `Subscription fatigue is the exhaustion that comes from managing too many recurring charges. It\'s real, and it\'s getting worse.

The subscription model went mainstream because it\'s great for businesses. Predictable recurring revenue, low churn, high lifetime value. For consumers, the economics are often worse — you pay forever instead of once, and you often pay for more than you use.

**The framework for deciding what to keep:**

**Active use:** Do you use it weekly? If not monthly? If you haven\'t used it in 60 days, that\'s your answer.

**Replacement cost:** If you canceled this, how would you replace the value? Spotify at $10/month vs. buying albums. Netflix vs. going to a theater. The comparison is often more favorable to the subscription than you\'d expect.

**Price anchoring:** $14.99 feels cheap. But 12 months at $14.99 is $180. Frame every subscription as its annual cost before deciding.

**The shared tier question:** Are you paying for a plan bigger than you need? Many services have a lower tier that covers 80% of your actual usage.

**The "if they raised the price 50%" test:** If this service cost 50% more tomorrow, would you still keep it? If no, you might already be on the edge of canceling.

**What to do after the audit:**
Keep what you\'d pay for even if it cost more. Cancel the rest. Track what\'s left so you always know what\'s due.

The goal isn\'t to cancel everything. It\'s to make intentional decisions instead of sleepwalking into charges every month.`,

    excerpt: 'You shouldn\'t have to pay to manage your money. Here\'s what\'s actually free in 2026.',
    date: '2026-05-20',
    category: 'Personal Finance',
    content: `Mint is dead. Everything else costs money. Or does it?

Here\'s the honest breakdown of what\'s actually free in personal finance software right now:

**Subscription & Bill Tracking:**
- **RenewalMate** — free, manual entry, no bank sync, full dashboard. Best for tracking recurring bills.
- **LowerMySubs** — free, subscription-focused, has cancellation guides for popular services.

**Budgeting:**
- **YNAB** — not free ($14.99/mo), but offers a free trial. Worth it if you commit to the method.
- **EveryDollar free tier** — basic zero-based budgeting, Dave Ramsey\'s app, limited features on free tier.

**Credit Monitoring:**
- **Credit Karma** — free, shows TransUnion and Equifax scores, solid monitoring.
- **Experian free tier** — free Experian score check monthly.

**Net Worth Tracking:**
- **Personal Capital/Empower free tier** — connects accounts, shows net worth, investment tracking. Free for basic features.

**Banking:**
- **Mercury** (for businesses) — free business banking, no minimums.
- **SoFi** — free personal banking with solid APY on savings.

**The honest conclusion:**
For bill and subscription tracking specifically, RenewalMate is the best free option that doesn\'t require bank access. For full budgeting with bank sync, the free tier options are limited — YNAB is the best paid option, Credit Karma\'s Intuit connections fill some of the gap Mint left.

The financial tools industry has decided you should pay monthly to understand your monthly spending. We disagree.`,
